== How It Works ==

Here’s how the TaxJar SmartCalcs Sales Tax API works.

TaxJar takes the following input from your store:

* Seller’s home state, city, and zip code
* Transaction amount
* The city, state, and zip code where item is being shipped
* Any shipping fees charged

And returns an accurate sales tax rate (including state, county, city, and special taxes) based on...

* Seller's nexus based on your WooCommerce ship from settings
* Any nexus with other addresses stored in your TaxJar account
* Local sales tax sourcing laws (origin-based or destination-based)
* Shipping taxability laws (shipping is not taxable in every state)

TaxJar for WooCommerce automatically determines:

* Nexus
* Origin vs. Destination sourcing
* Shipping taxability
* Sales tax rate (state county, city, special)
